# R6-Switcher: Rainbow Six Siege Game Version Switching and Launching Tool

[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆæœ¬](README.md)

## Project Introduction
This project is a small tool written in C++ for switching between the Steam and Uplay versions of Rainbow Six Siege by replacing the `defaultargs.dll` file. The tool also provides the ability to directly launch the game. It achieves version switching by reading and modifying a configuration file and supports updating the `defaultargs.dll` file to the corresponding program directory.
